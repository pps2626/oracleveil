This document serves as the final, non-negotiable command brief for creating The Oracle's Veil, a single-file React Tarot application dedicated to a premium user base in Myanmar. The core directive is simple: achieve an award-winning, cinematic standard of visual fidelity and interaction, treating the application not just as an app, but as an Interactive Sacred Altar. The AI must understand that Visual Quality, 3D Rendering Realism, and Animation Flow are the paramount priorities, requiring the use of the most powerful modern techniques like React Three Fiber (R3F) or Three.js.

The foundational requirements are absolute: The entire User Interface (UI), including all buttons, labels, and text, MUST be exclusively in the Burmese language. Furthermore, when communicating with the Gemini API, the systemInstruction must be rigorously engineered to ensure the reading response is generated NATIVELY in fluent, grammatical Burmese, bypassing any translation systems. Access to this premium application must be gated by a simple but exclusive six-digit numeric access key splash screen.

The 3D Environment must be spectacular, utilizing PBR (Physically Based Rendering) principles and high-fidelity lighting, including Volumetric Lighting (God Rays) and Ambient Occlusion, to create a palpable atmosphere. The full 78-card Tarot deck must be realistically scattered in a chaotic pile on a richly textured surface, such as deep-pile velvet or polished obsidian, allowing for user-controlled camera rotation to fully appreciate the depth.

The Card Draw Animation is the emotional climax and must be a Slow-Motion Reveal, lasting approximately 2-3 seconds. Upon raycast selection, the card must instantly glow, smoothly levitate, and perform a slow, deliberate 180-degree rotation to show its face. This sequence must be enhanced by cinematic effects, including an automatic camera Dolly/Zoom toward the card, a brief Chromatic Aberration or Depth of Field blur during the flip, and a final, satisfying sound effect using Tone.js upon placement. The three resulting spread cards (Past, Present, Future) must finish with a powerful, pulsating Bloom Effect to draw the user's focus.

Aesthetically, the application must live in Dark Mode as default but offering light mode option too, utilizing a limited but luxurious palette of deep navy, pitch black, and luminous, liquid Gold/Amber for all accents. Card detailing, though procedural due to asset restrictions, must simulate embossing or etching for a sense of antiquity and craftsmanship. The AI is encouraged to act as a senior developer, leveraging its autonomy to implement any additional features—such as post-processing filters, Ambient Soundscapes, or enhanced UI gradients—that further elevate the visual and cinematic experience, provided they do not violate the core language or security mandates.
